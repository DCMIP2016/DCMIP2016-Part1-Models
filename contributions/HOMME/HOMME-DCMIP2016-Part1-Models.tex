\section{Model Grids} \label{sec:ModelGrids}

{\color{red}[ALL] Add a short description of your model grid here.}

\subsection{Latitude-longitude grid}

\subsection{Cubed-sphere grid}

The equiangular cubed-sphere grid \citep{sadourny1972conservative, ronchi1996cubed} consists of six Cartesian patches arranged along the faces of a cube which is then inflated onto a spherical shell.  More information on this choice of grid can be found in \cite{ullrich2014global}.  On the equiangular cubed-sphere grid, coordinates are given as $(\alpha, \beta, p)$, with central angles $\alpha, \beta \in [- \frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{\pi}{4}]$ and panel index $i_p \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.  By convention, we choose panels 1--4 to be along the equator and panels $5$ and $6$ to be centered on the northern and southern pole, respectively.

\end{align} in terms of Kinetic energy $K = \vb{u} \cdot \vb{u}$, geopotential $\Phi = g_c z$ and absolute vorticity $\vg{\eta} = \vg{\zeta} + \vg{\Omega}$, which consists of relative vorticity $\vg{\zeta} = \nabla \times \vb{u}$ and planetary vorticity $\vg{\Omega}$.  The Exner pressure is related to the prognosed density and potential temperature via
\begin{equation} \label{eq:BaseNonhydrostaticEOS}
\Pi = c_p \left( \frac{p_0}{p} \right)^{R_d/c_p} = c_p \left( \frac{R_d \rho \theta_v}{p_0} \right)^{R_d/c_v}.

\begin{align}
\psi^{(1)} &= \psi^{(0)} + \tfrac{\Delta t}{5} f(\psi^{(0)}), \nonumber \\

\subsection{Tempest}

{\color{red}[ULLRICH]}

The Tempest model \citep{ullrich2014global, guerra2016high} uses a horizontal spectral element discretization and vertical staggered nodal finite element method based on the cubed-sphere grid with terrain-following height-based coordinate.  The standard Eulerian equations are employed with moist density $\rho$, thermodynamic closure $\theta_v$ and tracer density $\rho q$.  These continuous equations are given in section \ref{sec:TempestEquations}.  The implementation includes both fully explicit time integration, using the UKG53 scheme described in section \ref{sec:UKG53Scheme}, and implicit-explicit options, where horizontal terms are explicitly discretized and vertical terms are treated implicitly.  Scalar hyperviscosity is employed for $\rho$, $\theta$ and tracer variables via repeated application of (\ref{eq:scalar_viscosity_direct}).  Vector hyperviscosity is also applied by decomposing the horizontal vector Laplacian into divergence damping (\ref{eq:divergence_damping}) and vorticity damping (\ref{eq:vorticity_damping}) terms.  Both viscosity operations are applied after the completion of all Runge-Kutta sub-cycles.

\subsection{High-Order Method Modeling Environment (HOMME)}

{\color{red}[HALL]}

HOMME stands for the High Order Method Modeling Environment which provides the framework for the CAM-SE and ACME-Atmosphere dynamical cores along with several experimental versions  including a non-hydrostatic model. It was designed to be mass and energy conserving with nearly optimal parallel scalability at large core counts. The CAM-SE dynamical core is a hydrostatic model that partitions the globe horizontally using an unstructured grid of quadrilateral elements. These elements are arrange by default in a cube-sphere structure, but variable-resolutions grids with conforming edges may also be employed. Each quadrilateral extends in the radial direction to form a column using the shallow-atmosphere approximation $r\approx a$ where $a$ is the mean radius of the Earth. It employs a hybrid terrain-following / pressure coordinate $\eta \in (0,1]$ which transforms smoothly from a pure pressure coordinate at the top of the model to a terrain-following surface-pressure coordinate at the bottom. A conventional vector-invariant form for the moist primitive equations is employed with prognostic zonal and meridional wind components $u,v$, temperature $T$, surface pressure $p_s$, and tracer mixing ratios $q_i$. The PDEs are discretized using a split approximation, with a nodal 4th order spectral element discretization in the horizontal and the mimetic (mass and energy conserving) 2nd order finite difference discretization of \cite{simmons1981energy} in the vertical. Fields are co-located in the horizontal in the sense that they share the same 4th order basis functions. Lorenz staggering is employed in the vertical with (u,v,T,p) placed on layer midpoints while vertical fluxes $m \dot \eta$ are placed on layer interfaces.

A floating Lagrange formulation is used for tracer advection and optionally for the vertical dynamics as well, in which vertical levels are advected with the fluid. After several time-steps, the levels are remapped onto the fixed Eulerian $\eta$ grid in order prevent pressure surfaces from crossing. Several limiter options are available including a sign-preserving limiter and a monotone optimization base limiter described in \cite{guba2014optimization}. Diffusion is applied in the horizontal with a 4th order hyperviscosity operator, decomposed into two applications of the Laplacian operator in divergence / vorticity form. The physics, tracer, dynamics, and vertical remapping schemes are applied in a time split manner with adjustable sub-cycling ratios. Tracer advection is discretize in time with a 3-stage 2nd order strong stability preserving (SSP) scheme of Spitteri and Ruuth \cite{spiteri2002new}. The dynamics are also discretized using one of several explicit Runge-Kutta times schemes. Physics-dynamics coupling may be achieved using a single adjustment at the end of the physics timestep, through tendency update every dynamics step, or by a hybrid of the two.

In addition to the primitive equation model, HOMME also hosts an experimental nonhydrostatic dynamical core which retains many of the features of the traditional CAM-SE model. This model makes use of the shallow-atmosphere Euler equations of motion in terrain-following $\eta$ coordinates, as first described by \cite{laprise1992euler}. In its current incarnation, unstructured spectral elements are retained in the horizontal with matching spectral elements in the vertical. Prognostic variables include the 3d wind velocity components $u,v,w$, the surface pressure $p_s$, potential temperature $\theta$, and geopotential height $\phi$. Fields are current co-located in the vertical and explicit time-stepping is used. Planned improvements call for vertically implicit time stepping, and possible Charney-Phillips staggering. This model has been successfully applied to the dry DCMIP-2012 dynamical core tests including (vertical SE) tracer transport, orogoraphic waves, gravity waves, and the dry baroclinic instability. Moist dynamics, physics/dynamics coupling, and implicit time integration routines are currently under development.

\section{Idealized Physical Parameterizations}

\subsection{Kessler Physics} \label{sec:KesslerPhysics}

The cloud microphysics update according to the following equation set:
\begin{alignat}{5}
\frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t} = & - \frac{L}{c_p \pi} & \Big( \frac{\Delta q_{vs}}{\Delta t} & + E_r  \Big) & \\
\frac{\Delta q_v}{\Delta t} = & & \frac{\Delta q_{vs}}{\Delta t} & + E_r \\
\frac{\Delta q_c}{\Delta t} = & & - \frac{\Delta q_{vs}}{\Delta t} & & - A_r & - C_r \\
\frac{\Delta q_r}{\Delta t} = & & & - E_r & + A_r & + C_r & - V_r \pdiff{q_r}{z},
\end{alignat} where $L$ is the latent heat of condensation, $A_r$ is the autoconversion rate of cloud water to rain water, $C_r$ is the collection rate of rain water, $E_r$ is the rain water evaporation rate, and $V_r$ is the rain water terminal velocity.

The pressure follows from the equation of state
\begin{equation}
p=\rho R_dT(1+0.61q_v)
\end{equation} with $p$ the pressure, $\rho$ the density of moist air, $R_d$ the gas constant for dry air, $T$ the temperature and $q_v$ the mixing ratio of water vapor. The equation is rewritten as a nondimensional pressure $\Pi$ equation.
\begin{equation}
\pi = \left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right)^{\frac{R_dT}{cp}}
\end{equation}

To determine the saturation vapor mixing ratio the Teten's formula is used,
\begin{equation}
q_{vs}(p,T) = \left( \frac{380.0}{p} \right) \exp\left(17.27 \times \frac{T-273.0}{T-36.0}\right)
\end {equation}

The autoconvection rate ($A_r$) and collection rate ($C_r$) follow Kessler parametrization and are defined by:
\begin{align}
A_r &= k_1(q_c-a) \\
C_r &= k_2q_cq_r^{0.875}
\end{align} With $k_1=0.001 \text{s}^{-1}$, $a=0.001 \text{g}.\text{g}^{-1}$ and $k_2=2.2 \text{s}^{-1}$ 

Deriving from \cite{klemp1978simulation} description of cloud water,rain water and water vapor mixing ratios. they are define as followed:
\begin{equation}
q_c^{n+1}=\mbox{max}(q_c^r-\Delta q_r,0)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
q_r^{n+1}=\mbox{max}(q_r^r-\Delta q_r+S,0)
\end{equation} where $S$ is the sedimentation term and $\Delta q_r$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
\Delta q_r=q_c^n-\frac{q_c^n-\Delta \text{t}\ \mbox{max}(A_r,0)}{1+\Delta \text{t} C_r}
\end{equation}

The Rain evaporation equation is defined similarly to \cite{ogura1971numerical} description:
\begin{equation}
E_r=\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\left(1-\frac{q_v}{q_{vs}}\right)C(\rho q_r)^{0.525}}{5.4\times10^5+\frac{2.55\times10^6}{pq_{vs}}}
\end{equation}  With ventilation factor C define as 
\begin{equation}
C_r=1.6+124.9(\rho q_r)^{0.2046}
\label{venti}
\end{equation}

The liquid water terminal velocity is similar to \cite{soong1973comparison} description with a mean density adjustment as suggested by \cite{kessler1969distribution}:
\begin{equation}
V_r = 36349(\rho q_r)^{0.1346}\left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Simplified Mixing in the Planetary Boundary Layer} \label{sec:PlanetaryBoundaryLayer}

The forcing by the planetary boundary layer is described in \cite{reed2012idealized} and is partly reproduced here.  To parameterize the surface fluxes that impact the zonal velocity $u$, the meridional velocity $v$ and moisture $q$ we start with the time rate of change equations
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &=& - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho \ \overline{w'u'}}{\partial z} \label{eqturb}  \\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} &=& - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho \ \overline{w'v'}}{\partial z}  \label{eqturb_v} \\
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t} &=& - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho \ \overline{w'q'}}{\partial z}.  \label{eqturb_last}
\end{eqnarray}  Potential temperature, as opposed to temperature, is used in the boundary layer parameterization because the vertical profile of the potential temperature is a suitable indicator of static stability.  This adds the time rate of change equation
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial t} &=& - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho \ \overline{w'\Theta'}}{\partial z}.
\end{eqnarray}  Here $u'$, $v'$, $w'$, $\Theta'$ and $q'$ symbolize the deviations of the zonal velocity, meridional velocity, vertical velocity, potential temperature and specific humidity from their averages, respectively. The average is indicated by an overbar.  Note, assuming pressure is held constant (which is a common assumption in physical parameterizations), the potential temperature time tendency can be converted back to a temperature tendency of the following form
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} &=& - \frac{1}{\rho} \left (\frac{p}{p_0} \right )^{\kappa} \frac{\partial \rho \ \overline{w'\Theta'}}{\partial z}.
\end{eqnarray}
with the reference pressure $p_0 = 1000$ hPa.

The turbulent mixing is characterized by a constant vertical eddy diffusivity to represent Ekman-like profiles of boundary layers
\begin{eqnarray}\label{ktheory}
\overline{w'u'} = -K_m \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} \\
\overline{w'v'} = -K_m \frac{\partial v}{\partial z} \\
\overline{w'\Theta'} = -K_E \frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial z} \\
\overline{w'q'} = -K_E \frac{\partial q}{\partial z}. 
\end{eqnarray}
Here, $K_m$ is the eddy diffusivity coefficient for momentum and $K_E$ is the eddy diffusivity coefficient for energy and set equal to that for water vapor. In order to calculate the eddy diffusivity coefficients, the eddy diffusivity is matched to that for the surface flux calculated in Appendix~\ref{sec:OceanSurfaceFluxes} at the lowermost model level.  To allow for a smooth transition above the boundary layer ($p_{top} = 850$ hPa)  the diffusivity coefficients for momentum taper to zero as
\begin{equation} \label{Kmtaper}
\begin{array}{ll}
K_m = C_d \vert \vec{v}_{a} \vert z_a & \mbox{for} \; p > p_{top} \\
K_m = C_d \vert \vec{v}_{a} \vert z_a \exp \left ( -\left [ \frac{p_{top} - p}{p_{strato}} \right ]^2 \right ) & \mbox{for} \; p \leq p_{top}.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Here the constant $p_{strato}$ determines the rate of decrease and is set to 100 hPa. $K_E$ is defined by
\begin{equation}

We suggest implementing the boundary layer scheme with an implicit temporal discretization to avoid numerical instabilities. The details of this discretization are somewhat complicated, and so we refer to implementation details in Appendix D of \cite{reed2012idealized}. In addition, we supply the DCMIP modeling groups with the complete ``simple-physics'' package as used in the model CAM which can serve as a template routine.
